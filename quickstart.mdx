## Get Started

To get started, [sign up for our platform](https://subconscious.dev/platform) and create your account. You'll need platform access and an API key to continue.

## Try the Playground

For an immediate taste of our platforms's capabilities, try the playground. The playground provides a user-friendly interface where you can test prompts and tools with our inference engine and see results without writing any code.

## API Integration

### Create Your API Key

First, create an API key from your dashboard. **Important**: API keys are only shown once for security reasons. If you've lost your API key, simply create a new one from the "API Keys" tab.

### Using the Subconscious API

Our API is compatible with the OpenAI format in fits easily into a developer experience . Simply replace the base URL and add your API key.

### Python Example

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.subconscious.dev/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="tim-small",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a poem about happy news from today"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: 'https://api.subconscious.dev/v1',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'tim-small',
    messages: [
        { role: 'user', content: 'Tell me a poem about happy news from today' }
    ]
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

### cURL Example

```bash
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tim-small",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Tell me a poem about happy news from today"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

That's it! You're now ready to start building with Subconscious. The API works with any OpenAI-compatible tools and libraries - just update the base URL and API key.
