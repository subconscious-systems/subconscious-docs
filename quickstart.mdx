## 1. Create an Account

[Sign up for the platform](https://subconscious.dev/platform) and create your account. Then generate an API key from your dashboard.

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once. If you've lost your key, create a new one from
  the "API Keys" tab.
</Warning>

## 2. Try the Playground

Before writing code, try the [Playground](https://www.subconscious.dev/playground) to test prompts and see agents in action.

## 3. Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>

```bash Node.js
npm install subconscious
```

```bash Python
pip install subconscious-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## 4. Run Your First Agent

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node.js
import { Subconscious } from "subconscious";

const client = new Subconscious({
  apiKey: process.env.SUBCONSCIOUS_API_KEY!,
});

const run = await client.run({
  engine: "tim-large",
  input: {
    instructions:
      "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 stories",
    tools: [{ type: "platform", id: "web_search" }],
  },
  options: { awaitCompletion: true },
});

console.log(run.result?.answer);
```

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

client = Subconscious(api_key="your-api-key")

run = client.run(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 stories",
        "tools": [{"type": "platform", "id": "web_search"}],
    },
    options={"await_completion": True},
)

print(run.result.answer)
```

```bash cURL
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "engine": "tim-large",
    "input": {
      "instructions": "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 stories",
      "tools": [{"type": "platform", "id": "web_search"}]
    }
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

That's it! You've just run your first agent.
