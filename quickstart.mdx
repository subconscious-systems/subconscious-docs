## Get Started

To get started, [sign up for our platform](https://subconscious.dev/platform) and create your account. You'll need platform access and an API key to continue. Create an API key from your dashboard.

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once for security reasons. If you've lost your API
  key, simply create a new one from the "API Keys" tab.
</Warning>

## Try the Playground

For an immediate taste of our platforms's capabilities, try the playground. The playground provides a user-friendly interface where you can test prompts and tools with our inference engine and see results without writing any code.

## Official SDKs

We provide official SDKs for seamless integration:

</CardGroup>

## Using the SDKs

Our SDKs provide the simplest way to interact with Subconscious. Create a run, wait for completion, and get your results.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node.js
import { Subconscious } from "subconscious";

const client = new Subconscious({
  apiKey: process.env.SUBCONSCIOUS_API_KEY!,
});

const run = await client.run({
  engine: "tim-large",
  input: {
    instructions:
      "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 stories",
    tools: [{ type: "platform", id: "parallel_search", options: {} }],
  },
  options: { awaitCompletion: true },
});

console.log(run.result?.answer);
```

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

client = Subconscious(api_key="your-api-key")

run = client.run(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 stories",
        "tools": [{"type": "platform", "id": "parallel_search"}],
    },
    options={"await_completion": True},
)

print(run.result.answer)
```

```bash cURL
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "engine": "tim-large",
    "input": {
      "instructions": "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 stories",
      "tools": [{"type": "platform", "id": "parallel_search"}]
    }
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Streaming

Stream text as it's generated for real-time output:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node.js
import { Subconscious } from "subconscious";

const client = new Subconscious({
  apiKey: process.env.SUBCONSCIOUS_API_KEY!,
});

const stream = client.stream({
  engine: "tim-large",
  input: {
    instructions: "Write a short essay about space exploration",
    tools: [{ type: "platform", id: "parallel_search" }],
  },
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === "delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.content);
  } else if (event.type === "done") {
    console.log("\n\nRun completed:", event.runId);
  }
}
```

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

client = Subconscious(api_key="your-api-key")

for event in client.stream(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Write a short essay about space exploration",
        "tools": [{"type": "platform", "id": "parallel_search"}],
    },
):
    if event.type == "delta":
        print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
    elif event.type == "done":
        print(f"\n\nRun completed: {event.run_id}")
```

```bash cURL
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -N \
  -d '{
    "engine": "tim-large",
    "input": {
      "instructions": "Write a short essay about space exploration",
      "tools": [{"type": "platform", "id": "parallel_search"}]
    }
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Fire and Forget

Start a run without waiting, then check status later:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node.js
import { Subconscious } from "subconscious";

const client = new Subconscious({
  apiKey: process.env.SUBCONSCIOUS_API_KEY!,
});

const run = await client.run({
  engine: "tim-large",
  input: {
    instructions: "Generate a comprehensive report",
    tools: [],
  },
});

console.log(`Run started: ${run.runId}`);

// Check status later
const status = await client.get(run.runId);
console.log(status.status); // 'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
```

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

client = Subconscious(api_key="your-api-key")

run = client.run(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Generate a comprehensive report",
        "tools": [],
    },
)

print(f"Run started: {run.run_id}")

# Check status later
status = client.get(run.run_id)
print(status.status)  # 'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
```

```bash cURL
# Create a run
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "engine": "tim-large",
    "input": {
      "instructions": "Generate a comprehensive report",
      "tools": []
    }
  }'

# Check status later (replace RUN_ID with the returned runId)
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs/RUN_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

## OpenAI-Compatible API

Our API is also compatible with the OpenAI format, so you can use existing OpenAI libraries.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.subconscious.dev/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="tim-small-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the derivative of 3x^2 * sin(x)?"}
    ],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    if chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
        if delta and hasattr(delta, "content") and delta.content:
            print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.subconscious.dev/v1",
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "tim-small-preview",
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "What's the derivative of 3x^2 * sin(x)" },
  ],
  stream: true,
});

for await (const chunk of response) {
  if (chunk.choices && chunk.choices.length > 0) {
    const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content;
    if (content) {
      process.stdout.write(content);
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  TIM models currently require `stream=True` for synchronous chat completions
  when using the OpenAI-compatible API.

That's it! You're now ready to start building with Subconscious.
