## Get Started

To get started, [sign up for our platform](https://subconscious.dev/platform) and create your account. You'll need platform access and an API key to continue.

## Try the Playground

For an immediate taste of our platforms's capabilities, try the playground. The playground provides a user-friendly interface where you can test prompts and tools with our inference engine and see results without writing any code.

## API Integration

### Create Your API Key

First, create an API key from your dashboard. **Important**: API keys are only shown once for security reasons. If you've lost your API key, simply create a new one from the "API Keys" tab.

### Using the Subconscious API

Our API is compatible with the OpenAI format and fits easily into a typical developer workflow. Simply replace the base URL and add your API key.

### Async usage (high level)

If you expect calls to take a while, or you want stronger durability guarantees, you can use our async API. The flow is:

1. Call `POST /v1/chat/completions/async` to enqueue a job.
2. Use `GET /v1/requests/{requestId}/status` to poll for status and results.

Minimal curl example:

```bash
curl -sS https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/chat/completions/async \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tim-large",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Run this as an async job" }
    ]
  }'
```

The response includes a `requestId` you can pass to the status endpoint. For a deeper dive (including webhooks), see the “Async jobs and webhooks” guide in the Platform section.

### Python Example

**Note:** TIM models currently require `stream=True` for **synchronous** chat completions when using the OpenAI-compatible API.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.subconscious.dev/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="tim-small-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the derivative of 3x^2 * sin(x)?"}
    ],
    stream=True
    ## Example with no tools
)

# Stream and print the response
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

### JavaScript Example

**Note:** TIM models currently require `stream: true` for **synchronous** chat completions when using the OpenAI-compatible API.

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: 'https://api.subconscious.dev/v1',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'tim-small-preview',
    messages: [
        { role: 'user', content: 'What's the derivative of 3x^2 * sin(x)' }
    ],
    stream: true
    // Example with no tools

});

// Stream and print the response
for await (const chunk of response) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
}
```

### cURL Example

**Note:** TIM models currently require `stream: true` for **synchronous** chat completions when using the OpenAI-compatible API.

```bash
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tim-small-preview",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the derivative of 3x^2 * sin(x)"
      }
    ],
    stream: true
  }'
```

That's it! You're now ready to start building with Subconscious. The API works with any OpenAI-compatible tools and libraries - just update the base URL and API key.
