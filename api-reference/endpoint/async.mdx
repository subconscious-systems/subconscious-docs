description: 'Enqueue a long‑running chat completion job and poll for status'
---

The async API lets you submit chat completion requests that are processed in the background, instead of blocking on a single HTTP call.

At a high level you:

1. **Enqueue** a job with `POST /v1/chat/completions/async`.
2. **Poll** job status with `GET /v1/requests/{requestId}/status`.

### Enqueue an async job

```bash
curl -sS https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/chat/completions/async \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tim-large",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Run this as an async job" }
    ]
  }'
```

The response contains:

- `requestId` – the stable identifier you use when polling.
- `status` – typically `"pending"` immediately after enqueue.
- `estimatedCompletionTime` – rough estimate to help with UX.

### Poll job status

```bash
curl -sS https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/requests/REQUEST_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  | jq
```

The status payload includes:

- `status`: `pending | processing | completed | failed | cancelled`
- `jobId`: internal job identifier
- `model` / `engine`
- `result` (when completed)
- `error` (when failed)
- timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `startedAt`, `completedAt`)

You can poll until `status` is either `completed` or `failed`. For many workloads a simple loop with a small delay (1–5 seconds) is sufficient.
