## Welcome

The Subconscious API enables you to build powerful AI agents that can reason, use tools, and complete complex tasks. Our API is designed around **Runs** - discrete agent executions that process your instructions and return structured results.

## Core Concepts

### Runs

A **Run** represents a single agent execution. You provide instructions and optionally tools, and the agent works to complete the task. Runs can be:

- **Async** (`POST /v1/runs`) - Queue a run and poll for results or receive webhooks
- **Streaming** (`POST /v1/runs/stream`) - Stream execution events in real-time via SSE

### Engines

Choose from multiple inference engines optimized for different use cases:

| Engine              | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tim-large`         | Our flagship compound AI system with advanced reasoning and tool use |
| `tim-small-preview` | Fast, efficient model for simpler tasks                              |

### Tools

Agents can use tools to interact with external systems:

- **Platform tools** - Built-in capabilities like web search
- **Function tools** - Your custom HTTP endpoints
- **MCP tools** - Model Context Protocol servers

### Structured Output

Request structured responses using JSON Schema via `answerFormat` and `reasoningFormat` fields.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication:

```bash
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"engine": "tim-large", "input": {"instructions": "..."}}'
```

Get your API key from the [Subconscious platform](https://app.subconscious.dev).

## Quick Example

### Create an async run

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "engine": "tim-large",
    "input": {
      "instructions": "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "runId": "run_abc123...",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

### Poll for results

```bash
curl https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/runs/run_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response (when complete):

```json
{
  "runId": "run_abc123...",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "result": {
    "answer": "Recent developments in quantum computing include...",
    "reasoning": null
  },
  "usage": {
    "inputTokens": 1234,
    "outputTokens": 567,
    "durationMs": 45000
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Instead of polling, configure webhooks to receive notifications when runs complete:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.subconscious.dev/v1/webhooks/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "callbackUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhooks",
    "eventTypes": ["job.succeeded", "job.failed"]
  }'
```

Or attach a one-off callback URL to a specific run:

```json
{
  "engine": "tim-large",
  "input": { "instructions": "..." },
  "output": { "callbackUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhooks" }
}
```
