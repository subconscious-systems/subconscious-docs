## Welcome

Our API is designed with simplicity in mind. The core surface is OpenAI-compatible chat completions, making it easy to start experimenting with our TIM inference engines immediately. Simply swap out your OpenAI API key and endpoint, and you're ready to go.

## Current Offerings

Right now, we focus on doing one thing exceptionally well: **chat completions**. Our `/chat/completions` endpoint is fully compatible with OpenAI's API format, so you can integrate our TIM engines into your existing workflows without any code changes.

On top of the sync (blocking) chat completion API, we also expose an async flow for long‑running or durable work:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions/async` – enqueue a job.
- `GET /v1/requests/{requestId}/status` – poll job status and results.

The async API uses the same request shape as the sync endpoint; the main difference is that you get back a `requestId` immediately and fetch the result later.

We're adding a lot more functionality in the near future, but we wanted to release something as quickly as possible to get your feedback.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Simply include your API key in the Authorization header:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

Get started by generating your API key on the [Subconscious platform](https://app.subconscious.dev) and making your first request to experience the power of TIM engines.
