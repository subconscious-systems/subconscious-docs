## Get Started

To get started, [sign up for our platform](https://subconscious.dev/platform) and create your account. You'll need platform access and an API key to continue.

## Try the Playground

For an immediate taste of our platforms's capabilities, try the playground. The playground provides a user-friendly interface where you can test prompts and tools with our inference engine and see results without writing any code.

## API Integration

### Create Your API Key

First, create an API key from your dashboard. **Important**: API keys are only shown once for security reasons. If you've lost your API key, simply create a new one from the "API Keys" tab.

### Using the Subconscious SDK

Our official SDKs provide the simplest way to interact with Subconscious. Install the SDK for your preferred language and start building.
