## Browse Our Engines

Agent engines are available via serverless endpoint or dedicated endpoint.

## Beyond Models: Agent Engines

Our agent engines combine a language model with a custom inference runtime. We offer two engine types with one identical developer experience.

### Engine Types

**Unified Engines** - Co-designed model and runtime for peak performance on efficient models.

**Compound Engines** - Frontier models (OpenAI, Google) chained together with smart context management.

## Available Engines

| Name | API Name | Type | Description |
|------|----------|------|-------------|
| TIM-Edge | `tim-edge` | Unified | Highly efficient engine tuned for performance with tools |
| TIM-GPT | `tim-gpt` | Compound | Complex reasoning engine for long-context and tool use backed by the power of OpenAI GPT-4.1 |
| TIM-GPT-Heavy | `tim-gpt-heavy` | Compound | Complex reasoning engine for long-context and tool use backed by the power of OpenAI GPT-5.2 |

### TIM-Edge

TIM-Edge is our highly efficient unified engine, tuned for performance with search tools. It combines a co-designed model and runtime for peak performance, making it ideal for use cases where speed and efficiency are critical.

### TIM-GPT

TIM-GPT is a compound engine that provides complex reasoning capabilities for long-context and tool use, backed by the power of OpenAI GPT-4.1. This is our recommended engine for most use cases, offering a great balance of cost, performance, and reasoning ability.

### TIM-GPT-Heavy

TIM-GPT-Heavy is our most powerful compound engine, built for complex reasoning tasks with long-context and tool use, backed by the power of OpenAI GPT-5.2. Use this when you need maximum capability for the most challenging problems.

All engines can be used with either the sync or async APIs. In async mode, we enqueue work for a background worker to process and expose a simple polling + webhook story for long‑running jobs.
