## How Pricing Works

We offer two models with different pricing tiers based on your needs:

### Available Models

| Model | Input Tokens | Output Tokens |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **TIM-large** | $2.00 per 1M tokens | $8.00 per 1M tokens |
| **TIM-small-preview** | $0.40 per 1M tokens | $1.60 per 1M tokens |

### What Counts as Input vs Output Tokens

**Input Tokens** include:
- Your initial prompt
- Tool use response tokens that get added to the context window during inference

**Output Tokens** include:
- Only what the model generates (reasoning, parameters, final answer, etc.)
