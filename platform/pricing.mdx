## How Pricing Works

We offer two agent engines with different pricing tiers based on your needs:

### Available Engines

| Model | Input Tokens | Output Tokens |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **TIM-large** | $2.00 per 1M tokens | $8.00 per 1M tokens |
| **TIM-small-preview** | $0.40 per 1M tokens | $1.60 per 1M tokens |

### Input vs Output Tokens

**Input Tokens** include:
- Your initial prompt
- Tool use response values injected into to the context window during an agent run.

**Output Tokens** include:
- Only what the model generates. This includes reasoning tokens, parameters generation, and the final result.
