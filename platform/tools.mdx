Getting tools to work effectively with your AI agents requires a systematic approach. Here's how to ensure your tools are properly configured and performing optimally:

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Technical Foundation
Start by ensuring your tools work from a software perspective:
- **Access Control**: Verify you have the necessary permissions and API keys
- **Data Integration**: Confirm the tool can access and retrieve the required data
- **Security Boundaries**: Set appropriate limits and safeguards for agent interactions
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper fallback mechanisms for failed tool calls

### 2. Description and Prompting
Once the technical setup is complete, focus on how your agent understands the tool:
- **Clear Descriptions**: Write detailed, unambiguous tool descriptions that explain what the tool does and when to use it
- **Parameter Guidance**: Provide examples of proper input formats and expected outputs
- **Context Awareness**: Help the agent understand the tool's role in broader workflows

### 3. Iterative Optimization
Fine-tune your tools based on real-world performance:
- **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Track how and when tools are being called
- **Analyze Failures**: Identify common failure modes and edge cases
- **Refine Prompts**: Adjust descriptions and examples based on observed behavior
- **Test Systematically**: Use consistent test cases to measure improvement

## Custom Tool Optimization

Need more advanced help? We've worked with customers to post-train their custom tools for better performance, especially for tools with unique inputs and outputs that don't follow standard patterns.

Our optimization services include:
- **Custom Training**: Fine-tuning models specifically for your tool interfaces
- **Performance Analysis**: Deep analysis of tool usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- **Integration Support**: Hands-on assistance with complex tool configurations
