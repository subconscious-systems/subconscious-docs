Agents take in two primary inputs: goals and tools. A tool is a 
hosted API to accomplish some task that you manage and give our system access to.

## Tool Definition

All tools in Subconscious follow a consistent structure defined by these TypeScript types:

```typescript
export type Tool = {
  type: 'function' | 'mcp';
  name: string;
  description: string;
  url: string;
  method: 'POST' | 'GET';
  timeout: number;
  parameters: Parameters;
};

export type Parameters = {
  type: 'object';
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  required: string[];
  additionalProperties: boolean;
};
```

### Tool Properties

- **type**: Either `'function'` for custom tools or `'mcp'` for Model Context Protocol tools
- **name**: Unique identifier for the tool
- **description**: Human-readable description of what the tool does
- **url**: Endpoint URL where the tool is hosted
- **method**: HTTP method used to call the tool (`'POST'` or `'GET'`)
- **timeout**: Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for tool execution
- **parameters**: JSON Schema definition of the tool's input parameters

## Three Ways to Use Tools with Subconscious

Subconscious provides three flexible approaches to integrate tools with your AI agents, each designed for different use cases and complexity levels.

### 1. Schema Defined Tools

Pass tool schemas directly to the API for every interaction. This approach gives you complete control but requires you to self-host these tools.

**Best for:** Custom tools, one-off integrations, or when you need full control over tool implementation.

```javascript
tools: [
  {
    type: "function",
    name: "MyTool",
    description: "A custom tool for specific functionality",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        query: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The input query"
        }
      },
      required: ["query"]
    }
  }
]
```

### 2. Saved Tools

Save your tool specifications to simplify API calls. Once saved, you can reference tools by name in your requests.

**Best for:** Frequently used tools, team collaboration, or when you want to reduce API payload size.

```javascript
// First, save your tool specification
// Then use it in subsequent calls
tools: [
  {
    type: "your_tool_name"
  }
]
```

### 3. Subconscious Hosted Tools

We host these tools for you and they're available to use freely with your models.

| Tool Name | API Name | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Web Search | `web_search` | Search the web for information. |
| Webpage Understanding | `webpage_understanding` | Summarizes key information on web pages and suggests how to use in further searches (use with Web Search). |

**Best for:** Common use cases, rapid prototyping, or when you don't want to manage tool infrastructure.

```javascript
// Web search tool
tools: [
  {
    type: "web_search"
  }
]

// Webpage understanding tool
tools: [
  {
    type: "webpage_understanding"
  }
]

// Use both tools together for comprehensive web research
tools: [
  {
    type: "web_search"
  },
  {
    type: "webpage_understanding"
  }
]
```

## Getting Started

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

- **Schema Defined Tools**: For complete customization and control
- **Saved Tools**: For simplified, reusable tool management
- **Subconscious Hosted Tools**: For quick setup with common functionality

Each approach integrates seamlessly with Subconscious's AI agents, providing the tools your agents need to perform complex tasks and access external data sources.
