Getting started with Subconscious is straightforward: **set your goals, make your tools, and call the Subconscious API**. The platform handles the complex reasoning and tool orchestration for you.

## Basic Workflow

1. **Define your prompt** - Describe what you want the agent to accomplish
2. **Create your tools** - Define the functions your agent can use (optional)
3. **Call the API** - Send your request and get intelligent results

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Calling an Agent with No Tools

The simplest use case - just send a prompt and get a response.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

# Initialize the client
client = Subconscious(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Make a simple request without tools
run = client.run(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 * sin(x)"
    },
    options={"await_completion": True}
)

# Print the answer
print(run.result.answer)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { Subconscious } from "subconscious";

// Initialize the client
const client = new Subconscious({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

// Make a simple request without tools
const run = await client.run({
  engine: "tim-large",
  input: {
    instructions:
      "Analyze the current market trends for electric vehicles and provide a summary.",
  },
  options: { awaitCompletion: true },
});

// Print the answer
console.log(run.result?.answer);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Example 2: Calling an Agent with One Tool

This example illustrates how tools are defined and passed to the API.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

# Initialize the client
client = Subconscious(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Make request with one tool
run = client.run(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Find the latest news about Tesla's stock performance this week.",
        "tools": [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "name": "web_search",
                "description": "Search the web for current information",
                "url": "TOOL_SERVER_URL",
                "method": "GET",
                "timeout": 30,
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "query": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The search query"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["query"],
                    "additionalProperties": False
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    options={"await_completion": True}
)

# Print the answer
print(run.result.answer)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { Subconscious } from "subconscious";

// Initialize the client
const client = new Subconscious({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

// Make request with one tool
const run = await client.run({
  engine: "tim-large",
  input: {
    instructions:
      "Find the latest news about Tesla's stock performance this week.",
    tools: [
      {
        type: "function",
        function: {
          name: "web_search",
          description: "Search the web for current information",
          parameters: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              query: {
                type: "string",
                description: "The search query",
              },
            },
            required: ["query"],
          },
          url: "TOOL_SERVER_URL",
          method: "GET",
          timeout: 30,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  options: { awaitCompletion: true },
});

// Print the answer
console.log(run.result?.answer);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Example 3: Calling an Agent with Multiple Tools

This example shows how multiple tools can be composed for more advanced agents.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from subconscious import Subconscious

# Initialize the client
client = Subconscious(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Make request with multiple tools
run = client.run(
    engine="tim-large",
    input={
        "instructions": "Research the current Bitcoin price, calculate the percentage change from last week, and email me a summary report.",
        "tools": [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "name": "web_search",
                "description": "Search the web for current information",
                "url": "TOOL_SERVER_URL",
                "method": "GET",
                "timeout": 30,
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "query": {"type": "string", "description": "The search query"}
                    },
                    "required": ["query"],
                    "additionalProperties": False
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "function",
                "name": "calculate",
                "description": "Perform mathematical calculations",
                "url": "TOOL_SERVER_URL",
                "method": "POST",
                "timeout": 30,
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "expression": {"type": "string", "description": "Mathematical expression to evaluate"}
                    },
                    "required": ["expression"],
                    "additionalProperties": False
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "function",
                "name": "send_email",
                "description": "Send an email notification",
                "url": "TOOL_SERVER_URL",
                "method": "POST",
                "timeout": 30,
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "recipient": {"type": "string", "description": "Email recipient"},
                        "subject": {"type": "string", "description": "Email subject"},
                        "body": {"type": "string", "description": "Email body"}
                    },
                    "required": ["recipient", "subject", "body"]
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    options={"await_completion": True}
)

# Print the answer

## Async workflows

All of the examples above use the sync (blocking) chat completion API. When you have long‑running tasks or want stronger durability guarantees, you can switch to the async flow:

- Enqueue work with `POST /v1/chat/completions/async`.
- Poll job status with `GET /v1/requests/{requestId}/status`.
- Optionally receive callbacks via webhooks when jobs complete.

See the “Async jobs and webhooks” guide in the Platform section for a deeper walkthrough of the async pipeline and how to plug it into your own systems.

## Interpreting Results

When using the Subconscious SDK, the agent's reasoning and final answer are contained within the `run.result.answer` field as a JSON string. This field contains structured JSON that represents the agent's reasoning process and final output.

### Response Structure

The object follows this TypeScript interface:

```typescript
export interface ModelResponse {
  reasoning: Task[];
  answer: string;
}

export interface Task {
  thought?: string;
  title?: string;
  tooluse?: ToolCall;
  subtasks?: Task[];
  conclusion?: string;
}

export interface ToolCall {
  parameters: any;
  tool_name: string;
  tool_result: any;
}
```

### Response Fields Explained

- **`reasoning`**: An array of `Task` objects that show the agent's step-by-step reasoning process
- **`answer`**: The final, human-readable answer to your original prompt

### Task Structure

Each task in the reasoning array can contain:

- **`thought`**: The agent's internal reasoning about what to do next
- **`title`**: A descriptive title for this reasoning step
- **`tooluse`**: Details about a tool call, including:
  - `parameters`: The input parameters sent to the tool
  - `tool_name`: The name of the tool that was called
  - `tool_result`: The result returned by the tool
- **`subtasks`**: Nested tasks showing more detailed reasoning steps
- **`conclusion`**: The agent's conclusion after completing this reasoning step

### Example Response

A simplified `run.result.answer` response will contain JSON like this:

```json
{
  "reasoning": [
    {
      "title": "Analyzing the request",
      "thought": "I need to search for information about Tesla's stock performance",
      "tooluse": {
        "tool_name": "web_search",
        "parameters": {
          "query": "Tesla stock performance this week"
        },
        "tool_result": {
          "results": [
            {
              "title": "Tesla Stock Analysis",
              "snippet": "Tesla's stock has shown..."
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "conclusion": "Found relevant information about Tesla's stock performance"
    }
  ],
  "answer": "Based on my search, Tesla's stock performance this week shows..."
}
```

### Other Response Fields

The complete API response also includes:

- **`usage`** - Token usage information for the request
- **`model`** - The model that was used for the completion

This structured response format allows you to:

- **Understand** how your agent arrives at its final answer
- **Debug** your agent's reasoning process
- **Monitor** tool usage and results
- **Optimize** your tool configurations
