## Overview

Logs serve as a comprehensive history of your interactions with our system and provide valuable insights for debugging your agents and understanding their thinking and reasoning processes.

## What We Log

### Requests and Responses
We automatically log every request you send through Subconscious, including:
- **Your input requests** - The complete request data you submit
- **Model outputs** - The full response from our AI models
- **HTTP status codes** - Success (200), client errors (400), and server errors (500)

### Usage Tracking
We track your usage across all platforms:
- **Playground usage** - All interactions in our web interface
- **API usage** - Every API call made to our endpoints

## Accessing Your Logs

You can view all your logged data directly in our platform dashboard, giving you complete visibility into your system interactions and performance.

## Privacy and Sensitive Data

If you're working with sensitive information that you prefer not to be recorded in our logs, please [contact our team](mailto:privacy@subconscious.dev) to discuss custom logging arrangements.

## Benefits

Our comprehensive logging system helps you:
- **Debug issues** - Quickly identify and resolve problems
- **Monitor performance** - Track response times and success rates
- **Understand agent behavior** - See the complete reasoning process
- **Audit usage** - Maintain detailed records of all interactions


## Async jobs and webhook logs

For async workloads and webhooks there are a few additional places to look:

- **Worker logs**
  - Async worker: processes jobs from the queue and calls the engine.
  - Webhook worker: delivers webhook POSTs and handles retries/backoff.
  - Logs include:
    - `requestId`, `jobId`, `deliveryId`, `orgId`,
    - `durationMs`, `queueAgeMs`, `status`, `errorCode`.

- **Queue health and scaling**
  - We emit metrics and alarms around:
    - Async queue age,
    - Webhook queue age,
    - Async and webhook DLQ depth.
  - This makes it easy to spot stuck backlogs or failing deliveries.

- **Local test logs**
  - When you run our helper scripts (for example `run-all-tests.sh`), we write:
    - `*-jest.log`, `*-tsc.log`, `*-env.log`, and queue snapshots
      under `apps/api/test-logs/` in the monorepo.
  - These logs help you verify that your environment is wired correctly and make regressions easy to detect.
