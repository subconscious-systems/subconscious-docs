Subconscious is a developer-first platform for building production-ready AI agents. We provide a complete agent system that handles context management, tool orchestration, and long-horizon reasoning, so you can focus on defining what your agent should do. Our platform works with any service or tool, including MCPs, giving you everything you need to deploy sophisticated agents at scale.

### For AI tools

- [subconscious.dev/llms.txt](https://subconscious.dev/llms.txt) - Documentation index with links
- [subconscious.dev/llms-full.txt](https://subconscious.dev/llms-full.txt) - Complete documentation in one file


<Tip>
  **Build with AI coding assistants:** Let your coding agents understand the Subconscious API.
  
  ```bash
  npx skills add https://github.com/subconscious-systems/skills --skill subconscious-dev
  ```
  
  This gives Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI assistants deep knowledge of Subconscious, so you can build with the API faster.

  input: { instructions: "Summarize the latest AI news" },
  options: { awaitCompletion: true },
});

console.log(run.result?.answer);
```

## Engines

Our agent engines combine a language model with a custom inference runtime. We offer **Unified Engines** (co-designed model and runtime) and **Compound Engines** (frontier models with smart context management).
